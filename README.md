# LeBrown_Comic_App
Its an **unoffical** Android App that I made to test my Android knowledge. This comics belong to my cousion, you can check it
out at http://www.pigminted.com/ or follow his comic on facebook(https://www.facebook.com/pigminted), if you like. He got a real sense of
humor, and some of his comics are actually real good. </br>
This app was made so I could follow his comic a bit more conviently. At the same time its lot more exiting to work on a real life
project. Check the pics, videos and some documentation that I have got on here:</br>
